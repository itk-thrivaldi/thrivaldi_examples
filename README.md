# thrivaldi_examples
Basic examples of communication and control of the ITK-Thrivaldi robotics lab
Originally this referred to [thrivaldi_moveit_examples](https://github.com/itk-thrivaldi/thrivaldi_moveit_examples) but as that mainly presents moveit examples and has moveit related dependencies, this is a repository for simpler examples dealing with more direct communication and control.
